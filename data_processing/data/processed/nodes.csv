A11 (1996) 1-27 \\ Odd time was introduced to formulate the Batalin-Vilkovisky method of quantization of gauge theories in a systematic manner. This approach is presented emphasizing the odd time canonical formalism beginning from an odd time Lagrangian. To let the beginners have access to the method essential notions of the gauge theories are briefly discussed, and each step is illustrated with examples. Moreover, the method of solving the master equation in an easy way for a class of gauge theories is reviewed. When this method is applicable some properties of the solutions can easily be extracted as shown in the related examples. \\"
